Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that allows you to publish and subscribe to streams of records, similar to a message queue or enterprise messaging system. On the other hand, Spring Boot is a popular Java framework that simplifies the development of Java applications, making it easier to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

When it comes to using Kafka with Spring Boot, there are several libraries and frameworks available that provide integration and simplify the process. One of the most commonly used libraries is Spring Kafka, which provides a higher-level abstraction for interacting with Kafka within a Spring application.
